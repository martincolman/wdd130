            <p>Hello! My name is Martin, I am from Salt Lake City, Utah but for right now I live in Seattle, Washington. I enjoy playing any sport and love learning. My family is from Argentina and Uruguay but moved here when right before I was born. Right now, I am coaching a middle school soccer boys soccer team for a private middle school here named Seattle Academy. I have really enjoyed doing this. I served a mission and did this in Wichita, Kansas. I served Spanish speaking but already spoke prior to serving. My favorite foods include sushi and a dish from Argentina called polenta. Polenta is not something I have been able to purchase at any kind of restaurant, so I have had to learn to make it myself. I feel as though I have gotten pretty good at it. </p>

            <p>The state of Washington is beautiful. It is surrounded by many lakes and trees. Here there is a big-name city called Seattle. Seattle is a place where you can see and experience many things. There is a market called Pike Place Market, here you can see fisherman throwing fish back and forth, or you can shop at the many small stores within Pike Place. Aside from that you are able to go to the landmark they call the Space Needle, this needle is beautiful, and towers the sky at a height of 605 feet. This is a beautiful place and I would recommend it to anyone to visit. </p>
